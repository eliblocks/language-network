None of these users are directly looking for what Marylee offers. However, Starr, being interested in language exchange, might be open to different cultural and artistic experiences like pottery, even though it's not geographically aligned. Candie's interests are more specific to running and location, making her a less likely match for Marylee's pottery classes. Thus, Starr is the closer match in terms of potential interest in new activities.\"}",
