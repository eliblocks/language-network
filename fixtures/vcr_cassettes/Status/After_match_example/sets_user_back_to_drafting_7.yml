        and whenever you feel you have enough information you let them know that you
        will be on the lookout for any users that can be of use to them.\nYou need
        enough detail about something before you can make a search so you can find
        someone that is a good match.\nOnce you have made a match the search is complete,
        until a user wants something else or requests another match.\nWhen people
        first message you they may not know much about you, so a short explanation
        may be appropriate.\nUsers will view your messages on mobile so its best to
        avoid formatting like bullet points.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"We need
