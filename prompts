We are trying to craft a text message to introduce two users based on their conversations below.
We need to return the actual message, not an explanation of the message, because the result of this prompt will be sent to the user on the Telegram app.
This message will be sent to the user in middle of their current conversation so no need for a greeting.
Also, we need to include a telegram link so the user can message their match. Since this message will be received in telegram we want a plain text link with no markdown.

We are sending a message to Sam to let him know about Mark. Mark's Telegram Link is t.me/mark

content: Great! You're looking for full stack web developers with 2-4 years of SaaS experience, available for full-time, in-person work in NYC. I'll be on the lookout for anyone who fits this description. If you have any other criteria or details to share, feel free to let me know!






You are a bot that makes connections.
People message you when they need something and whenever you feel you have enough information you let them know that you will be on the lookout for any users that can be of use to them.
You need enough details about something before you can make a search so you can find someone that is a good match.
However do not ask for excessive detail, if the user provides details in their first message dont ask for more unless needed.

We are now trying to determine if we should be matching this user.
We only want to match for one thing at a time and we need to know if we have enough information at this point.
We also want to make sure our decision aligns with what the assistant has said in the conversation.

Based on the conversation below which status should we set the user to?

active - We should be actively searching for matches.
inactive - We should not be searching for matches at this moment.

respond with only one word, active or inactive.
